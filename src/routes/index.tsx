          If you found this page, you are most likely interested in making your
          own underwater drone. Well, you found us at the{' '}
          <strong>perfect time</strong>, because right now we are looking for
          beta testers for our Manafish kit, a kit containing:
        </p>
        <ul className='mb-6 ml-6 list-disc'>
          <li>
            <em>All</em> components needed to build your own 3D-printed
            underwater drone (40 different parts including motors, electronics,
            acrylic pipe etc.)
          </li>
          <li>50m tether that plugs into your PC with USB-C.</li>
          <li>
            Manafish assembly guide with video tutorials and lego-style
            instructions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Manafish software, that will be pre-uploaded to the
            microcontrollers, so absolutely no coding required!
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The <em>only</em> things you need are:
        </p>
        <ul className='mb-6 ml-6 list-disc'>
          <li>Access to a 3D-printer.</li>
          <li>Access to soldering equipment.</li>
        </ul>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          Manafish was designed with the intention of being sold as a kit from
          <em>day one</em>. That means you will be able to assemble your
          underwater drone in only a few days with a minimal amount of boring
          and time-consuming steps along the way. Even if you’ve never built
          electronics before, you’ll succeed.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          The design has already been made by 6 alpha-testers to ensure that it
          works consistently. If you for any reason get stuck while assembling
          your drone, we <strong>guarantee</strong> that we will personally sit
          on a video call with you and provide assistance until you know how to
          proceed.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          All of our beta testers will get the kit for a special early bird
          price of <span className='font-semibold'>$1200</span>, which is{' '}
          <strong>far cheaper</strong> than what it will be priced at the
          official launch (launch price will be{' '}
          <span className='font-semibold'>$1,800+</span>). If you apply at the
          bottom of this page we will contact you with more information once the
          kits are ready.
        </p>
        <p className='mb-4'>
          Applications are non-binding. If you don't want to become a
          beta-tester when the application is accepted, you just say so, and we
          take you off the list :). The applications will be evaluated in
          chronological order, so by applying now you maximize your chances of
          becoming a beta-tester.
